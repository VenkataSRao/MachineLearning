Introduction to MachineLearning:
==================================

Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides computers with the ability to learn without being 
explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can teach themselves to grow 
and change when exposed to new data.


Machine learning tasks are typically classified into three broad categories, depending on the nature of the learning "signal" or "feedback" available to a learning system. These are:

Supervised learning:
====================
 The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a "teacher", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs.


Unsupervised learning:
=======================
 No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end.

In reinforcement learning:
===========================
 a computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle), 
 without a teacher explicitly telling it whether it has come close to its goal or not. Another example is learning to play a 
 game by playing against an opponent.

Between supervised and unsupervised learning is semi-supervised learning, where the teacher gives an incomplete training signal: 
a training set with some (often many) of the target outputs missing. Transduction is a special case of this principle where the 
entire set of problem instances is known at learning time, except that part of the targets are missing.
